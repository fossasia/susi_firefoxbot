## Our Project Objectives

The central objective of this project is to develop a firefox addon for interacting with SUSI AI chatbot using WebExtension APIs.

### What is SUSI

Susi is an artificial intelligence combining pattern matching, internet data, data flow principles and inference engine principles. It has reflection abilities and it will be able to remember the user's input to produce deductions and a personalized feedback. Its purpose is to explore the abilities of an artificial companion and to answer the remaining unanswered questions.

### Why susi_firefoxbot

We noticed that users don't want to open susi web chat every time and would prefer to interact with SUSI while staying on the current tab. So, we figured that a web extension will solve this problem.
